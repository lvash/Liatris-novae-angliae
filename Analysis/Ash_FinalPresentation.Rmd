## *Liatris novae-angliae* Habitat

- Sandplain grasslands and coastal heathlands
- Disturbed anthropogenic habitats (roadsides) and natural habitats (fire)
- Do not flourish in forested areas

## Hypothesis

There are underlying factors that influence whether *Liatris novae-angliae* at a particular site is still extant or extirpated and historic.
   
**Predictions:** Values of predictor variables at sites where there are records of *Liatris novae-angliae* will significantly differ based on whether they are extant or extinct at those sites.

## Significance
- Absence data are rare finds!
- 'Historic' records are also different from being 'absent'
<center> ![BW](LnovaeSketch.png) <center>

## Getting Data 

- Conservation plan obtained from the New England Wildflower Society
- States: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and Maine
- Natural Heritage Programs for coordinates (130 points so far)

## Getting Data (continued)

- Latitude and Longitude at each site with QGIS
- Read Element Occurrence Record summaries to determine whether extant/extirpated/historic
- Predictors: 19 Bioclim variables

## Future Additions
- Add the rest of Massachusetts (possibly New Hampshire)
- Add land use and soil layers
- Compare historical climate layers
- More statistical tests
